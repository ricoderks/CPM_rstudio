This image is based on **rocker/hadleyverse**. I want to add some extra packages for me to work with.
Cloning the rocker/hadleyverse isn't probably the most elegant way of doing it, but for now it's fine.

A docker container based on rocker/hadleyverse with packages used within the CPM group. The extra package which are added are :
* xcms
* CAMERA
* IPO
* LOBSTAHS

Still need to add :
* Rcpm
* maybe snow
