This image is based on **rocker/verse**. I want to add some extra packages for me to work with.


A docker container based on rocker/verse with packages used within the CPM group. The extra packages which are added are :

* xcms
* CAMERA
* rsm
* pcaMethods
* pls
* preprocessCore
* plotly
* multtest (this if for XCMS)
* VennDiagram
* IPO
* LOBSTAHS
* Rcpm (everything for Rcpm is already in the Hadleyverse container)
